Hi, thanks for giving me a job <3

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Open the settings.config file with Notepad
2. Change the values of the Username, Password, and paste the message that you want to send.
3. Keep the config file in the same folder as the redditautomation.exe.
4. Copy geckodriver (also obtainable at https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) to C:\Windows\System32
5. Install Firefox browser
